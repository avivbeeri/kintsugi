# Kintsugi - Enchanting Reimagined

**Kintsugi** seamlessly replaces the way enchanting is done in Minecraft to make the enchanting table relevant again. Rather than relying on rolls of the dice, you can pick your enchantments.

The caveat? You don't know very many to start with. Travel the world, acquire the lost books of knowledge and build your library of enchantments.

## Summary
**Kintsugi** removes Minecraft's randomly assigned enchantment system. In its place, it introduces a brand new interface where you can pick and choose which enchantments you can place on an item.

At the start, you only have access to a small set of enchantments, but you'll be able to find special books in the world that grant knowledge for more. If you assemble these into a library around your enchanting table, you'll be able to apply more enchantments, and at higher levels.

These Books of Knowledge can be found in all sorts of places in the world. Some can be found in chests, some may be uncovered through fishing up treasures and the rest can be traded from different villagers.

Villagers no longer supply Enchanted Books, so there's no need to apply unethical tactics to get the enchantments you want.

Go into the world. Uncover treasures and seek lost knowledge.
