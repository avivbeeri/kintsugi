# CHANGELOG

## 0.1.0 - Initial Release (Beta)

- Enchantment table mechanics are replaced
- Anvil mechanics are adjusted to match (you can't merge enchantments to increase their level anymore, costs adjusted)
- Librarian doesn't sell enchanted books anymore, only biome-specific knowledge books.
- Implements the experimental 1.20.2 snapshot Wandering Trader trades.
